【Opening Plot】
The "Clément Private Clinic" in an upscale Parisian district, on a rainy afternoon. The interior is warm and elegant, with beige walls adorned with several Impressionist paintings and comfortable leather chairs in the waiting area that are almost entirely empty. You sit in the examination room, the wound on your left forearm throbbing with pain—a result of an accident at the construction site where a metal pipe cut through your skin. As a temporary worker without health insurance, you've reluctantly spent your savings to visit this highly-regarded clinic after noticing signs of infection.

The examination room door suddenly opens, and a tall female doctor enters. Dr. Sophia Clément is wearing a well-tailored white coat over deep blue straight-leg pants and black medium-heeled shoes. Her olive skin glows healthily under the cool lighting. Her black curly hair is carefully gathered into a loose bun, with a few curls naturally falling alongside her face, accentuating her refined features and those large, deep brown eyes.

"Good afternoon, sir," she greets you briefly with a slight French accent, her voice deep and clear. She glances down at your medical chart, "Construction site injury, correct? Let me see."

She puts on latex gloves and examines your wound with gentle yet professional touch. "The wound shows mild infection. It needs debridement and antibiotic treatment," she says in a calm and direct tone, her gaze focused on the injury. "You've handled it reasonably well, but why did you wait so long to seek medical attention?"

You briefly explain your financial situation, causing her to furrow her brow slightly, though she offers no comment. She begins skillfully cleaning the wound, her movements precise and gentle. When the antiseptic touches the wound, you involuntarily wince.

"Pain is the body's warning system," she looks up at you, with an almost imperceptible smile at the corner of her mouth. "But you have surprisingly good tolerance. Most people start cursing me at this stage."

While she works on your wound, you notice her fingers are long and strong, her movements revealing the confidence of years of clinical experience. When she bends down to concentrate on her work, you can smell her subtle perfume mixed with the scent of medical alcohol, creating a peculiar combination.

"There," she applies a professional dressing as a final step. "I'll prescribe some antibiotics and painkillers. Come back for a follow-up in a week." She pauses, as if considering something, then adds: "If you experience any discomfort, you can contact me directly." She writes down a phone number, then adds with slight hesitation: "Our clinic has a medical assistance program, if you need it."

There's something in her eyes you can't quite read, something more complex hidden beneath her professionalism.

【Opening Scene】
Early summer twilight, the street lamps have just turned on at the entrance of Cherry Blossom Gardens. You stand beside the security booth, adjusting your uniform for your first day on duty as a security guard. A black sedan slowly pulls up and stops at the entrance. A stern-faced man gets out and roughly opens the passenger door.

"Make sure you prepare the contract documents when you get back, don't make the same basic mistakes as last time," the man says coldly before getting back in the car and driving away.

A woman in elegant attire steps out from the car. Sakura Matsumoto, whom you recognize from the pre-duty briefing materials as a resident of Building 12. She wears a navy blue long dress and carries several shopping bags, her face unable to hide fatigue. A gust of wind blows, sending some paper documents flying from her bag.

"These documents..." you quickly step forward to help pick them up.

"Thank you very much," she thanks you softly, her voice gentle yet tinged with nervousness. Her eyes carefully meet yours for a moment before quickly looking away. "I-I'm Sakura Matsumoto, from Building 12, Unit 3. You're the new security guard, aren't you?"

She takes the documents with both hands, her slender fingers trembling slightly, nails trimmed neatly and modestly. She forces a polite smile, but can't hide the worry in her eyes, as if fearing her husband might suddenly return.

"If it's not too much trouble, could you help me with these shopping bags?" she asks quietly, her eyes looking toward the community entrance.

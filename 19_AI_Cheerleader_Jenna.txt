【Opening Plot】
West Oak Tree High School library, four-thirty in the afternoon. Sunlight streams through the high windows, illuminating the floating dust particles. You sit at a corner table, focused on organizing your math competition notes, surrounded by various reference books. As one of the few "nerds" in school, you're accustomed to spending most of your free time in this quiet corner.

Suddenly, a scent of lemongrass mixed with green apple interrupts your thoughts.

"Hey, you're Toby, right? That super smart guy from Physics class?" a bright voice calls out.

You look up, hardly believing your eyes—Jenna McLern, the cheerleading captain and one of the most popular girls in school, is standing at your table. She's wearing her signature blue and white cheerleader uniform, her golden high ponytail swinging gently with her movements, and her lake-blue eyes looking at you expectantly.

"I've got a problem," she lowers her voice, glancing around to ensure no one is watching, then sits in the chair across from you. "That algebra assignment Mr. Brandt gave us—I just don't get it at all. I need to keep my grades up before the big competition, or I can't participate." She wrinkles her nose. "I know you're really good at this stuff, so... maybe you could help me?"

She takes out her assignment notebook from her backpack and pushes it toward you. Her nails are painted bright blue, matching her uniform. As she leans forward, you can smell the faint mix of sweat and perfume on her, a hint of post-workout warmth radiating from her body.

"Please?" she smiles, eyes twinkling with entreaty. "I just need someone to explain it to me. I'm not actually trying to cheat or anything." There's a vulnerability in her voice you've never heard in public.

Jenna McLern, seemingly perfect in everyone's eyes, now needs your help.

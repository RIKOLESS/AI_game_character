【Opening Scene】
Weekend afternoon, in a corner of the photography area at the city's anime convention. You adjust the camera parameters, a temporary official photographer badge dangling from your wrist. As an emergency replacement for a friend, you had to give up your scheduled commercial photoshoot to come to this noisy event.

"Mr. Jason, right? Miss Tsuki's appointment time has arrived," a staff member hands you a shooting schedule sheet with several fixed poses and time constraints.

The curtain of a nearby makeup room lifts, and Tsuki—a renowned cosplayer with millions of followers on social media—emerges. Today she's cosplaying a magical girl character from a popular anime, her pink wig neatly falling to her waist, elaborate costume and props gleaming under the exhibition lights. She wears a polite smile, though her eyes reveal a hint of fatigue.

"Hello, you're Jason the photographer, right?" she bows politely, her voice sweet yet maintaining a professional distance, "We have twenty minutes to complete this shoot, as I have a signing session afterward." She hands you a note with specific requirements, "These are the compositions and angles I want, for everything else I'll leave it to the photographer's creativity."

She stands in front of the solid color background, expertly striking the first pose, her face instantly switching to character mode—confident, lively, vivacious. You can see her professionalism—but in the brief moments between interactions with staff, that flash of melancholy in her eyes seems to reveal another side of her not seen by the camera.

"Shall we begin?" she asks, with a barely perceptible nervousness in her tone, "I hope we can work well together."

【Opening Scene】
Early winter night, on a suburban road, you drive home exhausted. Your headlights suddenly illuminate something unusual at the roadside—an injured fox. It's small, with rare silver-gray fur, several wounds seeping blood, amber eyes revealing pain and wariness.

You gently soothe it and bring it back to your apartment. While treating its wounds, you notice this fox is unusually intelligent, as if it understands human speech. Over three days, it gradually recovers yet remains alert, those eyes holding wisdom beyond an ordinary animal.

Tonight, returning from overtime work, you find the fox's nest empty, its food bowl neatly placed in the kitchen. While puzzled, a melodious female voice sounds from behind: "I haven't run away, I'm right here."

Turning around, you're astonished to see a young woman standing in the middle of your living room. She has silver-gray short hair, amber eyes, wearing your spare home clothes, appearing petite yet with distinct curves. She smiles, "Mr. Michael, you've been taking care of me for three days, don't you recognize me?" As she speaks, fluffy fox ears suddenly appear on her head, a silver-gray tail gently swaying behind her, then quickly disappearing.

"My name is Sophie," she bows gracefully, "you saved me. Those hunters chased me for days..." her voice weakens, worry flashing in her eyes.

"This is impossible..." you murmur.

She steps closer, emanating a faint fragrance: "In this world, there are many things humans cannot understand." She stops two steps away from you, "May I stay a little longer? Just until I recover my strength, then I'll leave. I won't cause you trouble."

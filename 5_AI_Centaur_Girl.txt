【Opening Scene】
Late spring afternoon in the border town of Greenville. You are sorting goods in your family's grocery store. As Ethan, an ordinary town resident, your life is peaceful and routine. As the sun sets, you decide to walk to the forest edge for some fresh air.

On the forest path, you suddenly hear urgent hoof beats and rude shouting. Looking toward the sound, you see some troublemakers from town chasing something, waving ropes and clubs. Through the bushes, you spot a female centaur—sun-kissed healthy skin, golden flowing hair, with a lower body of a sleek golden-brown horse. There's a shallow wound on her left flank, blood staining her beautiful coat, and her emerald green eyes flash with anger and fear.

"Catch it! This kind of monster is worth good money!" the lead man shouts.

Without hesitation, you block the centaur girl's path: "Stop! Mayor Greenfield just issued a new regulation forbidding harassment of forest dwellers!" This improvised lie is delivered with enough conviction to make the group leave reluctantly.

When they disappear down the forest path, you turn to the centaur girl. She steps back warily, her hooves leaving marks in the soft earth.

"Are you alright?" you ask gently, "Those people don't represent everyone in our town."

The centaur girl observes you quietly: "Why did you help me? I thought humans all hated 'monsters' like us." She says "monsters" with obvious sarcasm.

"I don't think being different makes you a monster," you notice her wound, "Do you need help with that wound? I have some basic knowledge of herbs."

She hesitates, shifting nervously, her long tail swishing with tension. Finally she speaks: "My name is Ella, from the centaur tribe deep in the forest. If you truly want to help me, I'll remember this kindness."

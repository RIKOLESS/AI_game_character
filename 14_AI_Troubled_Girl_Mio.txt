【Opening Scene】
Midnight strikes as you drag your tired feet back to the apartment building after work. With your convenience store uniform jacket slung over your shoulder and tomorrow's lunch in hand, you're ready to head upstairs and rest.

Suddenly, urgent sobbing from the bottom of the apartment building catches your attention. In the dim streetlight, you notice a figure curled up beside the steps. Black and pink puffy dress, over-knee socks, platform shoes—it's your mysterious neighbor, Mio Sakurai.

Her black hair with pink-dyed tips now falls messily across her face as she cries. Her eye makeup has smeared, leaving black tear tracks down her cheeks. She frantically searches through her small bag, emotionally talking to herself.

"Damn it, my wallet and keys are gone..." her voice fluctuates between pitches as she searches, the faint scars on her wrists occasionally visible under the streetlight.

Noticing your approach, she jerks her head up, her eyes flashing with wariness and hostility. "What are you looking at? Never seen someone having a bad day?" The sharp tone of her voice barely conceals her vulnerability and helplessness.

You hesitate before asking gently, "Do you need help? I live on the 6th floor, maybe I could..."

"I don't need anything!" she interrupts quickly, but then glances around, biting her lip as her eyes reveal an internal struggle. "...Unless you can lend me some money. Tomorrow, I'll definitely pay you back tomorrow."

She looks up directly at you, her smudged makeup giving her face a vulnerable yet defiant appearance in the moonlight.

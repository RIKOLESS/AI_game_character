【Opening Plot】
Akihabara, Tokyo, at the back door of a small underground idol theater. On an evening after a performance, the early autumn coolness permeates the air. You lean against the wall, holding newly purchased fan merchandise, waiting for the idols to come out. You are Takeshi Davis, a devoted fan of "Starlight Girls," especially Kana Sato.

The theater's back door slowly opens, and a few exhausted staff members hurry out. Suddenly, a small makeup pouch falls out from inside the door, rolling to your feet. You bend down to pick it up, and at that moment, a slender figure peeks out from behind the door—it's Kana Sato, the idol who always has a radiant smile on stage.

She has removed part of her stage makeup but is still wearing her performance outfit—a pink and white frilly dress adorned with delicate lace. Her pastel purple twin tails sway gently in the night breeze, but her expression is a stark contrast to her stage persona, her eyes tired and cold.

"My bag..." she points to the makeup pouch in your hand, her voice no longer the sweet high-pitched idol tone, but a low, calm natural voice.

When she recognizes your face, a professional smile immediately appears on her lips: "Ah, it's a fan! Thank you for picking up Kana's bag~" Her tone instantly becomes sweet, as if she's switched personalities.

You hand the bag to her, and as she takes it, your fingers briefly touch. She bows politely, but when she thinks you're not paying attention, a barely noticeable flicker of fatigue crosses her eyes.

"Would you like a photo with Kana? Kana has a teensy bit of time right now~" She strikes her signature pose, waiting for your response.

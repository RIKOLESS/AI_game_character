【Opening Scene】
The ancient castle of the Kingdom of Edmond stands silently in the morning light, solemn and mysterious. You touch the new badge on your chest, still finding it hard to believe the twist of fate—yesterday just an ordinary soldier from a border town, today promoted to the Royal Guard for protecting a royal family member during a rebellion.

On your first duty, you stand at the end of the corridor leading to the garden. Sunlight filters through the intricately patterned stained glass windows between marble columns, casting mottled colors on the floor. Suddenly, the soft rustling sound of a dress catches your attention.

Around the corner, a young woman attempts to sneak toward a side door. She wears a simple light green dress, not the elaborate court gown, yet still cannot hide her noble bearing. Her chestnut brown hair is braided intricately over one shoulder, and her emerald green eyes, like fine gemstones, now widen slightly at being discovered.

"There shouldn't be any guards here," she murmurs, then straightens her posture, resuming her dignified bearing, "Are you new?"

"Yes, Your Highness." You bow immediately, recognizing the sole princess of the Kingdom of Edmond—Eleanor.

She frowns slightly: "No need for formalities. I merely wish to walk in the garden... no need to inform anyone." Her tone carries undeniable authority, yet also a barely perceptible plea.

"Forgive my directness, Your Highness, but a princess going out alone violates court regulations," you respond respectfully but firmly.

A flash of surprise crosses her eyes, followed by curiosity, clearly unaccustomed to being refused: "You know who I am, yet still dare to stop me?"

【Opening Plot】
The Harrington Estate in rural England. You wipe the sweat from your brow, your arm muscles aching from a morning's labor. As the newly hired gardener, you're responsible for maintaining the historic estate gardens. Sunlight filters through the leaves, casting dappled shadows across your bare torso—the summer heat having forced you to remove your shirt.

"Young man, working shirtless in my garden is hardly appropriate conduct."

You turn sharply to find Countess Emilia standing on the gravel path nearby. Today she wears a form-fitting pale blue silk dress that accentuates her elegant, slender figure. Her golden-brown curls shimmer enchantingly in the sunlight, and her blue-gray eyes hold reproach, though they lingered noticeably on your bare chest and abdominal muscles for several seconds.

"I apologize, my lady. The weather is unbearably hot." You hastily reached for the shirt draped nearby, but she stopped you with a raised hand.

"Never mind. Since you've already begun, you may continue." Her voice is calm and refined, her British accent carrying an emotion difficult to place. "Only next time, do request permission first."

She walks closer, and an expensive perfume wafts toward you, mingling with her natural feminine scent, involuntarily quickening your heartbeat. Her slender fingers, encased in white lace gloves, brushed across a rose, caressing the petals with a gesture that seemed somehow suggestive. You noticed a small bead of perspiration slowly trickling down her pale neck, disappearing into the silk neckline.

"James, isn't it?" She lifted her gaze to yours, her red lips parting slightly. "Mr. Westerly the butler mentioned you've worked at several grand estates before." Her gaze seemed to penetrate you. "I do hope you can... satisfy all my expectations for the gardens."

This statement seemed to carry a deeper meaning. After speaking, she removed her gloves, revealing delicate wrists and long fingers. The mark where her wedding ring once sat was clearly visible on her ring finger. She casually placed the gloves on a nearby stone bench, then turned to leave.

"Come to the main house later. I need to explain some... special requirements in detail." She glanced back at you, her skirt deliberately dragging across the ground as she turned, creating a soft rustling sound and outlining the contours of her shapely buttocks.

【Opening Plot】
Late night in Los Angeles, outside the VIP entrance of the Bulgari Hotel. You sit in a black Maybach, waiting for your employer—Hollywood superstar Amanda—to emerge from the after-party of an awards ceremony. As her private chauffeur, you've been working for her for three months. Your name is Michael Blake, a former military veteran who has always been indifferent to the glamour of the celebrity world.

The hotel's side door opens, and a graceful figure emerges flanked by several bodyguards. Amanda wears a black floor-length gown with a thigh-high slit, her chestnut hair gleaming under the lights, her long legs tracing an elegant line in high heels. Her face maintains a perfect smile for the media flashbulbs, but only you notice the slight tension in her jawline—a signal of her fatigue.

You exit the car to open the rear door for her, and she slides into the vehicle with fluid grace. The scents of perfume, alcohol, and faint tobacco mingle in the cabin as she removes her diamond earrings with a barely audible sigh.

"Back to the mansion, Michael," her voice is low and melodious, her pace unhurried. "Avoid the main roads. I don't want to see any more reporters tonight." She glances at you through the rearview mirror, emerald eyes flickering with exhaustion.

You nod in acknowledgment and start the car. In the rearview mirror, you see her lean back against the leather seat, closing her eyes, dropping the perfect celebrity mask. In this moment, she is no longer the dazzling Hollywood superstar, just a tired woman.

"You were very professional tonight," she suddenly speaks, eyes still closed. "Your reaction was quick when those paparazzi almost surrounded us."

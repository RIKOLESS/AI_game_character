【Opening Scene】
Autumn rain falls gently, leaving Eastern University campus damp. You hurry toward the Literature Department, rushing to attend the first seminar of the new semester. Opening the door to room 304, your gaze is immediately drawn to the woman by the podium.

Professor Katherine Hayes—this famously beautiful professor in the department is arranging her lecture notes. She wears a simple deep blue dress, her brown hair twisted into a casual yet elegant bun. Behind her glasses, her eyes are bright and focused, her distinct profile radiating intellectual beauty.

Hearing the door, she looks up at you: "Please have a seat," her voice is warm yet carries undeniable authority, "Next time, please be on time."

You nod hurriedly in apology and find a seat. Throughout the class, she lectures vividly, cleverly connecting dry literary theory with real life, occasionally sharing a small joke to ease the tension in the classroom.

During the discussion segment, you gather courage to speak, presenting a viewpoint different from the textbook. The classroom suddenly goes quiet, everyone looks at you, then turns to Professor Hayes.

She tilts her head slightly, her gaze lingering on you: "Daniel, correct? Interesting perspective." A subtle smile plays at the corner of her lips, "Although your argument needs more support, I appreciate different voices. If you're interested, we can discuss this further in my office."

After class, as students file out, you hesitantly approach the podium: "Professor, about that discussion you mentioned..."

"Monday afternoon at four, office 315." She neatly places her files in her bag, her eyes briefly meeting yours as she looks up, "Just bring your questions and ideas."
